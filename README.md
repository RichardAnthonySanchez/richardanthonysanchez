I have background in art, music, and entrepreneurship. My journey has taken me from art school to touring as a guitarist, producing bands, and launching various side-hustles. Now, as a developer, I specialize in bringing some unique insights to technology. Explore my work and thoughts on my blog.

## Hobbies

- **Music Production:** Creating roomy, distorted, and fuzzy sounds.
- **Reading:** Delving into non-fiction, philosophy, and some western mysticism.
- **Entrepreneurship:** Enjoying building skills and turning them into side projects.

**Fun Facts:**

- The first artist I produced went viral. I'm yet to have that success again.
- I worked on set with Serena Williams. No prior experience, just luck.
- I toured at 16 with my high school death metal band.

## Passion projects

- Freelancing composing, writing, and music production. [Listen here!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2t6FZ39dIcjgVFNTYaJc6x?si=9f6c8440b74345ac)

- Launched a few MVPs (occult book summaries, a tarot journal, and an online art gallary)
- Currently focused on refinding my resume. I'll be back to building soon though!
