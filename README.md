# Hey, I'm Tony 👋

I build **custom SEO tools** and **interactive client experiences** for marketing agencies. My focus is on creating lightweight, data-driven utilities that automate workflows and deliver measurable value.

## What I Do

I specialize in developing internal tools that help agencies scale their operations without scaling headcount. Think semantic analysis for internal linking, no-code data visualization widgets, and content migration utilities—all built with **TypeScript** and designed for real-world agency use cases.

**Core competencies:**
- Building client-side SEO utilities and analysis tools
- Creating interactive data visualizations for non-technical stakeholders  
- Automating repetitive SEO/content workflows
- Developing embeddable widgets and tools for client deliverables

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS, Web APIs, DOM manipulation
- **Tools & Libraries:** Node.js, various data processing libraries
- **Focus Areas:** Performance optimization, semantic analysis, data transformation

## Featured Projects

### 🔗 [Open Internal Link Juicer](#)
A semantic relevance-based tool for discovering internal linking opportunities. Helps SEO teams identify high-value link placements without manual content analysis.

### 📊 [Easy Chart Widget](#)  
Turn JSON data into embeddable charts with zero code. Built for agencies that need quick, professional data visualizations for client reports and dashboards.

### 🔄 [WP2GHOST Migration Tool](#)
Enhanced fork of jonhoo/wp2ghost. Converts WordPress XML exports to Ghost JSON imports while preserving content integrity and SEO metadata.

## Currently Working On / Learning

### 🤖 Agentic Assistant Workflows
Exploring how AI assistants can be integrated into development workflows and client-facing tools. Investigating prompt engineering, tool use patterns, and building applications that leverage LLM capabilities for SEO and content automation.

### 🎵 Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
Diving into audio programming and DSP fundamentals using:
- **JUCE** - C++ framework for audio applications
- **Faust** - Functional programming language for DSP
- **HISE** - Scriptable audio plugin development environment

Learning how to build audio effects, synthesizers, and sample-based instruments. It's a complete departure from web dev, but the mathematical and systematic thinking overlaps nicely with building data processing tools.

## Background

I come from a creative background—toured as a guitarist, produced bands, launched a few businesses. That experience taught me how to translate technical concepts into something that resonates with non-technical people, which is invaluable when building tools for agency clients.
