I have background in art, music, and entrepreneurship. My journey has taken me from art school to touring as a guitarist, producing bands, and launching various side-hustles. Now, as a developer, I specialize in bringing some unique insights to technology. Explore my work and thoughts on my blog.

## Hobbies

- **Music Production:** Creating roomy, distorted, and fuzzy sounds.
- **Reading:** Delving into non-fiction, philosophy, and some western mysticism.
