# Hey, I'm Tony 👋

I build custom SEO tools and client experiences for marketing agencies. Think: the internal utilities that make your team's life easier and the interactive deliverables that make your clients say "whoa, this is cool."

**TypeScript/JavaScript specialist** who actually enjoys solving the weird, specific problems that agencies deal with daily.

## What I Build For Agencies

The stuff that either saves your team hours of manual work or makes clients genuinely excited in presentations:

**Internal SEO Tools** – Semantic analysis for internal linking, content gap finders, automated audits that actually make sense  
**Client Deliverables** – Interactive dashboards and embeddable widgets your clients will want to show their boss  
**Workflow Automation** – All those repetitive tasks that make everyone groan  
**Migration Tools** – Moving content between platforms without losing your mind (or SEO value)

Everything's built to be lightweight and maintainable. No "well actually, you need to spin up a Kubernetes cluster" situations.

## Tech Stack

- **Primary:** TypeScript, NextJS, Node.js, and TanstackStart
- **Deployment:** Static sites, client-side applications, Railway, Digital Ocean VPS

## Recent Projects

### [Open Internal Link Juicer](https://github.com/RichardAnthonySanchez/open-internal-link-juicer)
Semantic similarity engine for finding internal link opportunities. Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to surface relevant content connections without the tedious manual analysis.

Typical content audit went from ~15 hours of someone highlighting spreadsheet cells to about 4 hours of actually strategic work.

**Built with:** TypeScript, Web Workers for processing, IndexedDB/Local Storage for caching

### [Easy Chart Widget](https://github.com/RichardAnthonySanchez/easy-chart-widget)
Zero-config tool: JSON goes in, embeddable charts come out. Made for client success teams who need to create visualizations but (rightfully) don't want to learn Shadcn.

Turns out when you make it easy for non-technical people to create beautiful charts, they actually use it. Wild, right?

**Built with:** TypeScript, Chart.js, inline SVG exports

### [WP2GHOST Migration Tool](https://github.com/RichardAnthonySanchez/wp2ghost)
Enhanced fork of a WordPress → Ghost migration tool. Handles the annoying edge cases: custom fields, SEO metadata, content that's formatted weird.

Because migrations should be boring (in a good way).

**Built with:** TypeScript, XML/JSON parsing, validation pipelines

## How I Do It

**I ship fast** – Most tools go from "hey, wouldn't it be cool if..." to production in 2-3 weeks

**Low maintenance burden** – Client-side first approach means you're not paying for servers to keep my stuff running. Also means I'm not waking you up at 2am because something crashed.

**Actually documented** – README files, inline comments, handoff docs. I write code like someone else will need to touch it later (because they will).

**I get the agency model** – Billable hours matter. Client communication matters. Sometimes "good enough and shipped" beats "perfect and never finished."

**TypeScript everywhere** – Type safety = catching dumb bugs before they become "hey Tony, the client's dashboard is broken" Slack messages

## What I'm Exploring Now

Playing with Agent Assisted workflows (Claude, Cursor, Antigravity) for mockups analysis and automated work. Figuring out where LLMs actually add value vs. where they're just expensive API calls.

Also tinkering with audio DSP stuff (JUCE, Faust) as a side hobby—completely unrelated to SEO work, but fun to mess with sound synthesis and signal processing.
